Achieve_quick_start provides a configuration / startup file for Achieve (HTTP/S/2) with WS Websockets and rooms.
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a> installed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/achieve">Install Achieve</a> for HTTP/S/2.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws">Install WS <i>globally</i></a> for Websockets.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/achieve_rooms">Install achieve_rooms</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>The quick start file is configured to use achieve_rooms with the WS websocket app and Achieve server. To learn to customize for other uses, visit the 
npm pages for each application.</p>
<h3>Using achieve_rooms</h3>
<p>Read the quick start at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/achieve_rooms">achieve_rooms</a></p>
<h3>The other components</h3>
<p>Achieve is a modern, high-performance, developer-friendly HTTP/S/2 web server. WS is advertised as being the fastest websocket server 
available for node. The quick start file mentioned above uses the "noserver" option for WS, which means that Achieve and WS use the same 
port numbers. This avoids problems with CORS. I have been using this combination for years, with great satisfaction.</p>
